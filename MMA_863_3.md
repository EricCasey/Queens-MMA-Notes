> _Why Should We Use A Data Driven Strategy vs. Managerial Intuition?_


### The Plant
* Can you get up a product list?
* Ask for additional data.
    * Do you have a stratification of your defects
    * Types of door made at Aurora Plant & revenue
    * Is there any overtime fee?

### The Promotion
* How much did the promotion cost? Cost Per Acquisition?

* What was the promotional discount?

* Was it print or digital?

* What proportion of your annual revenue comes from the two products from the promotion.

### The Warehouse
* Demand Supply Balance.
* Any savings between in-house vs. outsourced delivery




## Memo Notes
* Start with 6 months of collecting detailed data.
* 3 sections of analysis followed.
* Recommendations.
* Example: rework, just informal paper ledger.
