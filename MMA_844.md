# 844 Final Exam Outline
---------------------

## Stage 1: Individual, closed-book. ~2.4 hours

–Address several questions without reference to any other materials. Write your answers in exam paper and answer booklets (in classroom)

### Part A – 1 Question - Earned Value Management (EVM) scenario

You are part-way through executing a project. You have information about your project plan and progress to date. Do appropriate analyses to determine variances to-date and make forecasts for the rest of the project. Interpret results and suggest what the PM should do.

### Part B – 1 Question - PM Process

Discuss what should be done through the various stages of the life of a project if it was to be done using an adaptive/agile PM methodology. Compare and contrast this with a predictive/traditional/linear PM life cycle approach.

Assume you were brought in by the executive team and project office at a medium-sized company to introduce agile, adaptive project management to them. They decide the best candidate project to try this on first is a project that is **fairly complex** with **fairly high uncertainty**; however, the **scale of this project is modest**, implying a core project team of **under a dozen people**.

[13.5 points] Describe what they should do (as well as when and why) to effectively run their agile project. Explain your recommendations in enough detail so it is clear to the company what you are recommending (how to do it) and why your recommended actions/practices will be valuable and are necessary. Use PMI's generic PLC (project life cycle) to structure your answer.

(1) Starting the Project [initiating]

(2) Organizing and Preparing [planning]

(3) Carrying out the Work [executing, monitoring & controlling]

(4) Closing [an iteration or project]

So, specifically, for each of PLC phases, describe what should be done and why (justify the value/purpose).


[3.5 points] Conclude by describing possible advantages of using this agile, adaptive project management approach instead of a traditional linear approach for projects (i.e., why it might fit and provide advantages over a predictive/traditional project approach). 
Also describe the possible disadvantages/challenges of using an agile approach?

### Part C – 2 questions – Referring to Articles

[Option A] Most significant challenges for **analytics projects** faced by project leadership and/or project managers? Why? What should be done to address the challenges and why?

[Option B] Most significant challenges for **project leadership and/or project managers?** Why? What should be done to address the challenges and why?


Part C – 2 questions – you choose which ONE you prefer to address (referring to concepts and material from the course…)

C1_a) 	Identify what you think are the 3 most significant **challenges of analytics projects** for project managers and/or the project leadership of an organization. Explain each of your challenges in enough detail so it is clear what the challenge is, as well as why it exists (i.e., the causes). Then justify your choice as to why each of the three is a significant challenge (using concepts from the course and our readings), as well as being the most significant for this type of project. (7 marks)

C1_b) 	Using concepts from the course and our readings, explain how project managers and/or project leadership should deal with each of the three challenges to maximize the odds of being successful. That is, for each of the three challenges, provide recommendations and clearly explain how the recommendations address the challenge and will positively impact a project. (3 marks)

C2_a)	Based on what you have learned in this course, describe what you think are the three most significant **challenges for organizations/project leadership and/or project managers** to have their chosen projects be successful. Explain each of your challenges in enough detail so it is clear what the challenge is, as well as why it exists (i.e., the causes). Then justify your choice as to why each of the three is a significant challenge (using concepts from the course and our readings), as well as being the most significant. (7 marks)

C2_b)   Using concepts from the course and our readings, explain how project managers and/or project leadership should deal with each of the three challenges to maximize the odds of being successful. That is, for each of the three challenges, provide recommendations and clearly explain how the recommendations address the challenge and will positively impact a project. (3 marks)







## Stage 2: Team, open-book. ~1.5 hours

Work on it together to create one electronic file, that you submit to the course dropbox. A subset of the questions from the individual exam, with some minor changes. You will have breakout rooms/areas to work in
