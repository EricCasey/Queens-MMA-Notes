## Session 1.1 - Part 1: The Basics
---------------------
### Types & Representation of Data


### Populations & Samples
* Population: All relevant items of interest
* Sample: A random sub-section of the population

DGP - Data Generating Process
    * 

### Descriptive Stats
Descriptive Stats:
> The presentation of information or conclusions based on either a sample or a population. For example, to present the daily production volume over the past year for a sample of employees

Inferential Stats: 
> The use of sample data to reach a conclusion about a population. For example, to determine if production levels are increasing over time, or if they fall by more than 10% after a long weekend

### Types of Data [basic-->neat]

#### Data-type Hierarchy
* Nominal [Male/Female]
    * True/False, in-category or out
    * Numeric values have no meaning
* Ordinal [Low/Medium/High]
    * Rank is meaningful
    * Range between
    * Levels of satisfaction
* Interval [Temperature]
    * Distance between values have meaning
    * No absolute 0
    * Percentages don't make sense
* Ration [starting salary]
    * Distance between has value
    * There IS an abslute 0
    * Percentage makes sense

#### Time-Related Data
* Cross-Sectional
    * No time dimension
* Time-Series Data
    * Where time matters
* Panel Data
    * Blending of Time-Series & Cross Sectional

### Story Telling
* Summary Stats
    * Mean, Median, Mode
    * Q1, Q3, IQR (Interquartile Range)
    * P-value
    * Variance (&sigma;<sup>2</sup>)
    * Stan Dev (&sigma;)
* Tables
* Graphs/Charts
    * Shapes of Histograms
        * Bell Shaped 
            * denotes central limit theorum
            * Empirical rule
                * If a distribution is bell-shapes, 68% are within 1 &sigma;
            * Chebyshev's Theorum
                * _something else_
        * Skew (pos/neg)
            * "Ski you to the left?"
            * "Ski you to the rignt?"
        * Bi-Modal

## Session 1.1 - Part 2: Probability
---------------------

#### Gambler's Fallacy
> The belief that 'runs' occur to statistically independent phenomena such as roulette wheel spins.

#### Hot Head Fallacy
> I just won solo fortnite with no kills
> So I must be good

#### Available Heuristic
> tendency to overestimate the likelihood of events with greater availability in memory.

#### Base Rate Fallacy / Base Rate Neglect
> Tendencies to ingnore base rate information and focus on specific information

#### Conjunction Fallacy
> Tendency to assume tha tdpecific conditionare are more probably than others

#### Experimenter's Bias 
> tendency for experimenter to belive data that agrees with their expectations

#### Neglect of Probability
> Tendency to disregard probability when making a decision under uncertainlty

#### Overconfidence effect
> Excessive confidence in one's own answers to questions (I'm 99% sure, but only 40% get it correct)


### Foundations

_What is probability?_
* Classical
    * 
* Relative Requency
    * The rate at which something happens in the data
* Subjective
    * 

### Rules

#### Rules of Probability
> Probabilities apply to events (i.e. one outcum of an experiment) within a sample space. An elementary event is an event that cannot be decomposed into other events. A sample space is the collection of all possible elemnentary events associated with an outcome.

#### Events
* Mutually exclusive events
    * Not independent events, like heads and tails, can't happen at the same time.
* Independaent events
    * Where the event has nothing to do with the probability of the other events.
* Complement of an event
    * Is the event that makes up the rest of the sample space.
    * _"The complementary rule of haircuts"_ - Keith Rodgers
        * Ask them if they've recently had a haircut, the answer is always "it looks nice".
* Collectively exhaustive events
    * The full list of all events.
* Union 
    * { 1, 2 } â‹ƒ { 2, 3 } = { 1, 2, 3 }
    * The union of two events is the collection of elemnets that exist in either of them.

### Bayes Theorum
    * 

### Visual Ways To Solve Problems
* Trees
    * Hierarchical tree thigns to plot out numbers
* Tables
    * A Matrix
 * Formulae
    * Just writing it all out.

## Session 1.1 - Part 3: Probability Distributions
---------------------

### Random Variables
_... is a rule or function that assigns a numericcalue to the outcomes of a random experiement_

#### Discrete Distributions [COUNTABLE]
> Probability Mass Functions
> "How Many Dollars Do You Have?"
_countable, even if there are infinite possiblities. But no in-between numbers or decimals_

##### Binomial
>"Maximum Upper Limit"

`=BINOM.DIST(num,trials,prob,bool)`

- Fixed number of independent trials.
- Success of Failure only.
- RV is the number of successes.
- We have an experiment involving n identical trials.
- There are only possible outcome: success or a fail

##### Poisson
>"Can always imagine more"

`=POISSON.DIST(num,trials,prob,bool)`

- Things happen randomly at a fixed rate.
- RV is the # of occurrences.
- The number of events that occur in any interval is independent of the number of events that occur in any other interval.
- The probability of an event in an interal is the same for all equal sized intervals.
- No upper limit



#### Continuous Distributions [UNCOUNTABLE]
> Probability Density Functions
> "How Much Money Do You Have"
_non-countable, more measurable. Like distance being 0.0001 cm or time being 0.00001 min_

</p>

##### Uniform
> a Uniformly distributed random variable is one wher all equally sized interval within the variable range have equal probability of occuring. Like a clock, infinite possible positions, but standard scale.

##### Normal
> &sigma; = Standard Deviation

> &sigma;<sup>2</sup> = Variance

> &mu; = Mean

> Z = z-score = (x - &mu;) / &sigma;

> n = the number of things

> k = the number of variables each n has

> &lambda; = used for rates?

> &alpha; = aplpha

* Normal Distribution

`=NORM.DIST(x,mean,standev,bool)`

* Normal Standard Distribution
Z-Score to Probability: 

`=NORM.S.DIST(z,bool)`

Probability to Z-Score

`=NORM.S.INV(probability)`

## Session 1.2 - Working Session
---------------------

NOTE: Normal disribution has a center of &mu; while normal standard distribution has a center of 0. ND is for telling the probability of an event NDS is for telling an event's probability.

### Problem 1

1.	Use the data in the Excel file, test the following hypothesis.  In each case, report the calculated p-value and report what it means.

    a.	H0: Mu_x = 0 

> unclear 

    b.	H0: Mu_x <= 0

> unclear 

    c.	H0: Mu_X >= 0

> unclear 

    d.	H0: Mu_X >= 5

> unclear 

### Problem 2

2.	Outline what might be a reasonable null and alternative hypothesis associated with the following situations:

    a.	You suspect that a new machine might have a lower error rate than the old one.

    > New machine does not have lower error rate

    b.	Your delivery company uses the 401 to commute, but the 407 might be faster.  Since it is a toll road, the 407 would only be justified if it cut 20 min off the trip.

    > 407 does not cut off at least 20 mins.

    c.	If men and women respond differently to your advertising campaign, you will need to look into it more and possibly design gender-specific promotions.

    > men & women do not responde differently


### Problem 3

3.	Every morning you receive an email outlining your tasks for the day.  On average you receive about 14 tasks but the actual number varies from day to day.  Each takes 30 minutes to do.  What is the probability that you:

    a.	Finish all your work with an hour or more of free time?

    > 47.95% ?

    b.	Finish all your work with no free time?

    > 4.56% ?

    c.	Not be able to complete your work?

    > 34.03% ?

### Problem 4

4.	Someone told me that in Vancouver it rains on about 40% of days.  How large a random sample of days would I need to check to estimate the true percentage within 1% and 95% confidence?

> 368.78 ?

### Problem 5

5.	The hotel in Kingston has 100 rooms.  It is a popular hotel and any given room is rented out about 95% of the time.  I am hosting a business meeting in Kingston and require ten rooms.  Am I likely to get them?

> 1.6% exactly 10 rooms or 2.8% more 10 or more ?

### Linear & Matrix Algebra

`=MINVERSE(A:A)`

`=MMULTIPLY(A:A)`

### Hypothesis Testing

Type I Error: H<sub>0</sub> is true but regected.

Type II Error: H<sub>0</sub> is false but accepted.

Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>):
* The equality bound always goes into the null hypothesis. i.e. the >= & =< are always in H<sub>0</sub>

_A priori_ -> 'from the earlier'
_A posteriori_ -> 'from the later'

"The bigger the effect, the easier to detect."

#### Power
* Alpha (&alpha;)
    * risking it all. 0.01 &alpha;
    * nbd. 0.6 &alpha;
    * &alpha; = 1 - confidence interval
    * The probability of making a Type I Error
* Beta (&beta;)
    * The probability of making a Type II Error


## Examples

#### Hypothesis Generation Example

1) The average duration of a cold is 5 days; my mom recommends chicken soup. But I don't like it, should I try the soup?
> H<sub>0</sub>: Soup Won't Help
> * _Sick Days >= 5_
> * &mu; >= 5

> H<sub>1</sub>: Soup Helps
> * _Sick Days < 5_
> * &mu; < 5

2) I would like to show that the market is stable â€“ that the program's starting salaries this year are the same as last year.
> H<sub>0</sub>: Market is stable
> * _2017 Salary === 2018 Salary_
> * &mu;<sub>2017</sub> = &mu;<sub>2018</sub>

> H<sub>alt</sub>: Market is not stable
> * _2017 Salary !== 2018 Salary_
> * &mu;<sub>2017</sub> !== &mu;<sub>2018</sub>


#### Alpha & Error Questions
1) Should you run a 10% of 20% price discount this weekend to increase traffic to your store? 

2) Targeted ads on social media are five times as expensive but appear to be twice as effective.


#### Two Population Example
1) 
* H<sub>0</sub>: Y<sub>wear</sub> >= X<sub>wear</sub>
    * Y lasts shorter or the same
* H<sub>1</sub>: Y<sub>wear</sub> < X<sub>wear</sub>
    * Y lasts longer

2)

### Communication

Consider a professional writing course.

##### The Truth

* Nobody cares what your opinion is.
* Nobody cares what your opinion is.
* Nobody cares what your opinion is.
>
* They will care if you own the company.
* They will care if your mommy or daddy owns the company.
* They will care a little bit if you're old and experienced.
>
* 


##### Approaching Writing

###### The Dangerous Method
* Prepare an outline of key topics, points and sequence.
* Do all the reading/learning you can on a topic, then go for a walk and don't talk to anyone.
* Do all the reading/learning you can on a topic; then explain it to a colleague or subordinate. 


###### Direct Writing
* Divide available time into two halves.
* Briefly think about the audience.
* Spend the first half of your available time writing everything you think/know belongs in your deliverable. This involves the 'creative voice'. Do not get caught up on style, errors, complete sentences, thoughts or details. Intermix words, paragraph stems, ideas, etc. Just get it down on paper. If necessary, use highlighting or parenthetical comments to track thinking.
* At halfway point stop writing and start editing. Now the 'critical voice' takes over. Start by identifying the good bits and the bad bits. Then move chunks around to their proper location, correct flow and structure between then within paragraphs, finally correct sentences and fill in details. With that done, revise again from beginning to end. Give it a break then do it again.

Remember: _Only a sith deals in absolutes._

##### A Template

*  First sentence should be ultra quick.
