H2) What can I add to help my strategy

* Focus on NA

* They have until the end of 2018 until the fog appears

* Revenue is declared when points are spent, not earned.

* Reward: $0.66/$1.00
* Admin: $0.36/$1.00

* Partner want more control over rewards 

Wait... how to keep people on aeroplan until devorce date or how to keep AIMIA alive now and after?

Is their 'cash reserves' going to get consumed by points transfers.
